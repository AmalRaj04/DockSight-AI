# Execution Mode — STRICT AGENT BUILD

This project is built under STRICT EXECUTION MODE.

## Global Rules

1. Implement ONLY what is explicitly defined.
2. Do NOT add features, abstractions, or optimizations unless requested.
3. Do NOT refactor existing code unless it is broken.
4. Do NOT invent chemistry, docking data, or scientific results.
5. Prefer simple, readable code over clever code.
6. Each component must be independently testable.
7. No speculative AI behavior is allowed.

## Agent Constraints

- The agent is a deterministic, multi-step pipeline.
- The agent does NOT self-improve or self-modify.
- The agent does NOT make autonomous scientific claims.
- The agent uses LLMs only for explanation and writing.

## Out of Scope (Explicit)

- Molecular dynamics simulations
- De novo molecule generation
- Reinforcement learning
- Tokenomics or NFTs
- On-chain storage of raw scientific data
- Automated drug approval claims

## Success Criteria

The project is considered complete when:

- Docking results can be ingested
- Ligands are ranked correctly
- Visualizations are generated from real poses
- A structured scientific report is produced
- Analysis metadata can be attested on Solana
